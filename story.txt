There once was a man named John. John was really good at cooking. He could make anything you would dream of. But he was most famous for baking cakes. His cakes were moist and sweet, but they were also highly decorated. John makes huge stuctures that get shaped into incredible life-like creations. He is an expert in his field but he was not always so good.
