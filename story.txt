There once was a man named John. John was really good at cooking. He could make anything you would dream of. But he was most famous for baking cakes. 
His cakes were moist and sweet, but they were also highly decorated. John makes huge stuctures that get shaped into incredible life-like creations. He is an expert in his field but he was not always so good.
One time John made gigantic dinosaur-shaped cake, that he named Kris, that he brought to the annual cake competition in his hometown. However, when the judges arrived at his cake, the cake collapsed...
It was totally a disaster that made everyone frustrated. John was so sorrowful that he cried immediately. He believed that his dinosaur-shape cake would be the first prize without any doubt. However, now everything was different. Ten minutes later, John came up a new idea. He decided to name the collapsed cake as "disaster", a vivid description of the situation. The judges were so surprised that they gave this "disaster" cake first prize.
